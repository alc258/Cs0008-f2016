#time=input('How long did you travel')
time1= 6 #hours
distance=speed*time1
print("The car will go " + str(distance) + " kilometers in 6 hours.")
time2= 10 #hours
distance=speed*time2
print("The car will go " + str(distance) + " kilometers in 10 hours")
time3=15 #hours
distance=speed*time3 #distance formula
print("The car will go " + str(distance) + " kilometers in 15 hours")
time4=2.25
distance=speed*time4
print("The car will go " + str(distance) + " kilometers in 2.25 hours")
